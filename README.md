# College Papers Repository

This is a collection of some of the papers and reports I wrote during my final year of college. 

LateX was used to write all of these reports and each has an associated practical element.

#### Final Year Project

Abstract:
>This project provided a complete management which could be used with any Docker installation, remote or otherwise. Currently Docker is predominantly controlled by developers using the command line. While this can be a strength it is also a weakness if the developer is inexperienced with Docker. This project therefore used modern tools and technologies to create a graphical interface which any developer could use to control their Docker installation.

Technologies:
>Docker, Node JS, Express router, Angular JS, Vagrant, Travis CI, mocha

#### The Automation of Infrastructure Orchestration and Application Deployment using Ansible and Docker Swarm

Abstract:
> Modern applications are becoming increasingly complex, meaning it can also be complex to deploy the application. This research paper will examine application deployment, and will aim to show how modern tools and technologies can be used to simplify the process of building and deploying an application to the cloud. 

Technologies:
> Docker Swarm, Ansible, AWS

#### Collecting Detailed Metrics from Docker Swarm Hosts

Abstract:
> The aim of this research paper is to demonstrate how, using several different technologies, a swarm host can be dynamically polled and the collected metrics displayed graphically. It will show this method of data collection can be turned into a template so that it can be re-used for each new host which is added to the swarm.

Technologies:
> Docker Swarm, Ansible, Grafana, Prometheus

#### Docker Security

Abstract:
> This paper will aim to investigate the overall security of a technology such as Docker. It will look at the tools at the core of Docker security, how we can ensure they are at their most secure and then also look at a real-life example of how container security can cause problems.

Technologies:
> Docker, cgroups, capabilities, namespaces
