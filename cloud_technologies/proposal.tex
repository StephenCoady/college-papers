The Automation of Infrastructure Orchestration and Application Deployment using Ansible and Docker Swarm

\paragraph{Introduction:} 
\label{par:Introduction}
Application deployment is becoming ever-increasingly complicated. This research paper aims to look at modern tools such as Ansible and Docker Swarm to see how they can aid in deployment. 

\paragraph{Objectives:}
\label{par:Objectives}
The objective of this research paper is to show how a modern automation tool such as Ansible can be used to provision and orchestrate the application cluster. \newline
\newline
Some tasks it will be used to carry out are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Deployment of application servers
	\item Provisioning of the above servers
	\item Deployment of the application to the servers
\end{itemize}
\newline
Another aim of this research paper is to show how Docker, and more specifically Docker Swarm, can be used to deploy an application to a cluster of servers.
\newline
\newline
Some tasks it will be used to carry out are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Creating a single point of contact with multiple application servers for easy management
	\item Creating an application that runs inside a container
	\item Creating a fault-tolerant application
	\item Easy scaling
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outcome:}
\label{par:Outcome}
The outcome of this research paper will be an application which is fully distributed across multiple servers, is fault-tolerant and can be scaled reliably which has been completely deployed using the automation tool Ansible.
