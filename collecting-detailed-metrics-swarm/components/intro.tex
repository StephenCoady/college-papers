\section{Introduction}
The aim of this research paper is to demonstrate how, using several different technologies, a swarm host can be dynamically polled and the collected metrics displayed graphically. It will show this method of data collection can be turned into a template so that it can be re-used for each new host which is added to the swarm. It will also show how this process can be automated so that no action is required from the administrator each time a new Swarm service is created.

This paper will also examine the options available for real-time or live feedback on these hosts, for example an alternative to Amazon Web Service's CloudWatch. It will then compare these tools and processes to those available natively by using Docker. It will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both.
