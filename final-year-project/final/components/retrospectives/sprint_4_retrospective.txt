2017-03-13 Docker Project Sprint 4 RetrospectiveDate13 Mar 2017ParticipantsStephen Coady Leigh GriffinRetrospectiveWhat did we do well?* Better scoping of story points as a result of last retrospective* Re-scoped mid sprint which I hadn't done before - leads to more accurate metrics* Tickets were made more descriptive before this sprint. This meant less time spent before starting a task figuring out what was needed* The velocity of this sprint was much higher than previous sprints, this is a combination of not having as many college commitments during this sprint and also as a result of better re-scoping mid-sprint.* Agile methodology maturity is clear to see now. Tickets are more accurate, estimates are accurate and a mastery of the methodology is really clear from my side (Leigh)What should we have done better?* Getting container logs had not been researched properly as the data was a stream but could also be requested as a JSON object, missed this flag which wasted a lot of time parsing streams to JSON.* Should have looked at the Docker remote API documentation in detail sooner. Would have saved time instead of relying on third party module 'Dockerode' which has little to no documentation.Actions* Stephen Coady align defined critical path with remaining backlog so that 'nice-to-haves' are separated from 'must-haves'* Stephen Coady to send naming conventions is it LifeCycle Management for Docker, or UI or LCMS or something random!
