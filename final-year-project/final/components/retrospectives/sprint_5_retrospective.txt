Lead to a very predictable sprint* Used previous knowledge of JWTs to decrease the time taken to implement them* Design choice of not using breadcrumbs was a good one, as validated by user acceptance testing* Managed to close out the last of the college project deliverablesWhat should we have done better?* JWT implementation impeded by forgetting to include re-writing of tests in the ticket* Sprint retrospective not carried out immediately after sprint ended, made it a more laborious taskActions*
