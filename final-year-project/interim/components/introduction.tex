\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this report is to detail the \gls{lifecycle management} for \gls{docker} application. It will aim to explain all elements of the project by examining the proposed methodologies and technologies which will be used and evaluating the risks associated with a project such as this one. It will also look at the design and implementation by using formal tools such as the unified modelling language (UML).

This project is being undertaken with a local company, Red Hat Mobile, acting as product owners. Red Hat have a vested interest in solving the problem discussed in Section \ref{sub:problem} and so will act as product owners in the development of this product. This will ensure that the initial requirements will accurately aim to solve the problem. 

The project supervisor, Dr. Brenda Mullally, will also act as Scrum master. This will ensure that the product backlog accurately reflects the state of the project at any moment in time.
