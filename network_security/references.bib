@article{Virtualization2016,
abstract = {For a long time, the term virtualization implied talking about hypervisor-based virtualization. However, in the past few years container-based virtualization got mature and espe- cially Docker gained a lot of attention. Hypervisor-based virtualization provides strong isolation of a complete opera- ting system whereas container-based virtualization strives to isolate processes from other processes at little resource costs. In this paper, hypervisor and container-based virtualization are differentiated and the mechanisms behind Docker and LXC are described. The way from a simple chroot over a container framework to a ready to use container management solution is shown and a look on the security of containers in general is taken. This paper gives an overview of the two different virtualization approaches and their advantages and disadvantages.},

@article{Whitepaper2016,
abstract = {Operating System virtualization is an attractive feature for efficiency, speed and modern application deployment, amid questionable security. Recent advancements of the Linux kernel have coalesced for simple yet powerful OS virtualization via Linux Containers, as implemented by LXC, Docker, and CoreOS Rkt among others. Recent container focused start-ups such as Docker have helped push containers into the limelight. Linux containers offer native OS virtualization,segmented by kernel namespaces, limited through process cgroups and restricted through reduced root capabilities, Mandatory Access Control and user namespaces. This paper discusses these container features, as well as exploring various security mechanisms. Also included is an examination of attack surfaces, threats, and related hardening features in order to properly evaluate container security. Finally, this paper contrasts different container defaults and enumerates strong security recommendations to counter deployment weaknessesâ€“ helping support and explain methods for building high-security Linux containers. Are Linux containers the future or merely a fad or fantasy? This paper attempts to answer that question.},
